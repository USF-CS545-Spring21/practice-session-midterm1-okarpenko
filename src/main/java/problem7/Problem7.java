// Problem 7:
// Assume the range of values in the array of integers A is from 1 to m,
// and that you have a modified counter array C from counting sort computed by first
// incrementing C[A[i]] for each element of A[i] and then setting each element of C for i from 1 to m to:
//        C[i] = C[i] + C[i-1].
// Write a function numBetween(int c[], int m, int low, int high)
// that takes as input this C array, m, and two values low and high,
// and returns the number of elements in the original list A whose values are between low and high, inclusive.
// Array A may contain duplicates, and you should be able to handle this.
// Running time of your function should be constant, Î˜(1).

// Solution: see the code below.
// Consider the input array given in the main method [8, 4, 7, 1, 3, 4, 5, 4, 1, 6, 0, 1, 5, 4, 7],  assume
// the keys range from 0 to 8, and consider the corresponding counter array: [1, 4, 4, 5, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15].
// Observe c[i] contains the the number of elements in the original array that are less or equal to i.
// So c[high] contains the number of elements that are less than  or equal to high.
// For instance, to compute how many values we have that are less than or equal to 2,
// we can access c[2] = 4 (and indeed, in A, we have four numbers that are 2 or less:  0, 1, 1, 1).

//To compute the number of values in the range from low to high (inclusive),
// we can access c[high] to get the total number of values that are less than or equal to high,
// and then subtract the number of values that are strictly less than low - this value is stored in c[low - 1].
