Problem 2:
Show the following list after the first partition operation, using the last element as a pivot:
 9, 39, 3, 15, 17, 7, 29, 1, 10, 28, 21, 18

Your Answer:
First, we swap 39 and 10, then 29 and 1. Then i and j cross, and we swap the element at index i with 18, the pivot.
9 10 3 15 17 7 1 18 39 28 21 29
